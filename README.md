# Bitsy-Game---Pz-VIII-Maus-The-German-Monster-of-Steel

The purpose of this Bitsy piece is to express a non-fictional narrative. In this case it will revolve around the creation and trials of the Panzer VIII Maus super heavy tank created by Germany during the 2nd world war. This piece will hopefully express how the Maus was supposed to be a turning point in the war but ultimately become insufficient by its cons and pros of being a near 200 ton vehicle. The player will take control of the Maus and go through a set of trials that were meant to test the Mausâ€™ capabilities and weaknesses. The player would periodically return to a NPC/sprite to receive new dialog after each test and then ultimately end the game once all the tests are all done. It will hopefully make the player feel like a powerhouse but also feel very limited in what they can do because of how the Maus was performing by making the paths seem passable but actually not because of the issues that the tank had.
